B. Java will first look for the most specific matches it can find, starting with Dolphins_en_
US.java and then Dolphins_en_US.properties. Since neither is found, it drops the country and looks
for Dolphins_en.java. Since a match is found, there is no reason to go on to the next one, which
is Dolphins_en.properties.
