E. This question looks like it is about generics, but itâ€™s not. It is trying to see if
you noticed that Map does not have a contains() method. It has containsKey() and
containsValue() instead. If containsKey() was called, the answer would be false
because the 123 in the list is an Integer rather than a String.
