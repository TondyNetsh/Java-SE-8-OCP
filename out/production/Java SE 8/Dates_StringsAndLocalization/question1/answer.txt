Which of the following creates valid locales, assuming that the language and country codes
follow standard conventions? (Choose all that apply.)
A. new Locale("hi");
B. new Locale("hi", "IN");
C. new Locale("IN");
D. new Locale("IN", "hi");
E. Locale.create("hi");
F. Locale.create("IN");

=============================================================================================

A, B. Choices E and F are incorrect because a Locale is created using a constructor. The
convention is to use lowercase for a language code and uppercase for a country code. The
language is mandatory when using a constructor, which makes choices A and B correct.
